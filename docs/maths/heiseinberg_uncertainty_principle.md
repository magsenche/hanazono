#Â Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

`Heisenberg Uncertainty Princinple`
: A signal concentrated in time must have a spread out fourier transform

Trade-off:

- the shorter the observation is, the less confidence you can be about the frequency observed
- short signals correlates with wide range of frequencies
- only wide signals correlates with short range of frenquencies
