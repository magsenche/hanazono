: Neurophysics is a branch of biophysics that develops and utilizes physics theories to study neural systems

> From a Darwinian perspective, one potential reason for the brain to feature criticality lay in that the most informative parts of external world principally occur at a borderline between purely ordered and purely disordered states (information would be trivial in a purely ordered world while it would be incomprehensible in a purely disordered world)

??? question "How does the darwinian perspective explain the brain's tendency towards criticality?"
    From a Darwinian perspective, the brain might feature criticality because the most informative parts of the external world primarily occur at a boundary between purely ordered and purely disordered states. In a purely ordered world, information would be trivial, while in a purely disordered world, it would be incomprehensible

> Brain criticality refers to a family of critical processes in neural dynamics where erratic fluctuations appear to reduce dynamic stability

> Self-organization : 	A process where the internal complexity of a system increases without being tuned by any external mechanism. All potentially emergent properties are created by endogenous feedback processes or other internal factors inside the system.

The brain may function at the "critical point".

Why is it evolutionnary advantaged? $\Rightarrow$ more sensitive to changes in input. But as the brain is not a closed system, it cannot be strictly critical: it may be quasicritical. What is the homeostatic mechanism that maintain the brain in this state?

At critical point, information transmission is **optimal**

??? question "What are the implication of the brain functionning at the critical point?"
    The brain being at the "critical point" is evolutionarily advantageous because it becomes more sensitive to changes in input. At this critical point, information transmission is optimal. However, since the brain isn't a closed system, it might be "quasicritical" and there's a need to understand the homeostatic mechanism that maintains the brain in this state
