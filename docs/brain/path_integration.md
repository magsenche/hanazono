#Â Path integration

`Path integration`
: A navigational process where an organism calculates its position using internal cues about distances and directions traveled, rather than external landmarks.

In mammals, navigation seems to rely on an **internal network keeping track of the relative position and orientation**, from an arbirary starting point, on the basis of integration of self-motion cues derived from:

- locomation
- vestibular activation
- optic flow
