## Amygdala
The amygdala is a small almond-shaped structure located in the temporal lobe of the brain.

- plays an important role in the processing of emotions and memories, particularly those related to fear and anxiety.

- interacts with other areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, to regulate stress responses and learning

## Cerebellum
The cerebellum is a structure located at the back of the brain that is responsible for coordinating muscle movements and maintaining balance.

- plays a role in cognitive functions, such as attention and language processing.

- interacts with other areas of the brain to regulate these functions.

## Entorhinal cortex
Area of the brain's allocortex, located in the medial temporal lobe, whose functions include being a widespread network hub for:

- memory
- navigation
- perception of time

## Habenula
These nuclei are hypothesized to be involved in regulation of monoamines, such as [dopamine](../health/dopamine.md) and serotonin.
The habenular nuclei are involved in

- pain processing
- reproductive behavior
- nutrition,
- sleep-wake cycle
- stress responses
- learning.

## Hippocampus
The hippocampus is a structure located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain that:

- plays an important role in memory formation and consolidation.
- interacts with other areas of the brain, such as the amygdala, to regulate stress responses and learning.
- interacts with other structures in the brain to maintain homeostasis and regulate cognitive functions.

??? question "What is the role of the hippocampus?"
    - plays an important role in memory formation and consolidation
    - regulats stress responses and learning
    - maintains homeostasis and regulate cognitive functions

??? question "What is the main role of the amygdala?"
    - plays an important role in the processing of emotions and memories, particularly those related to fear and anxiety
    - regulates stress responses and learning
