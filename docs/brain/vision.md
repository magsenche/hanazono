#### [Biologically Inspired Deep Learning Model for Efficient Foveal-Peripheral Vision](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.746204/full)
It has been estimated that processing costs for the brain are reduced by a factor of 350 times less than a hypothetical full-resolution visual signal received at the human retina.

Photographer's bias in an assumption that in human produced photos and videos, the region of interest is primarily located near the center of the image.

Log polar

- transform used to mimic retina sampling
- is computationnaly efficient because rectangular output
- can be scale & rotation equivariant

Similar sampling method using concentric squares instead of circles
