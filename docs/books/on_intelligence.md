# On Intelligence

## 5 - New Framework

Brain uses memory to form prediction:

- parralel (not serial predictions)
- constant (no need to ask any "internal" question)
- unconscious
- not "object oriented"
- primary function of the neocortex
- probabilistic (has a degree of uncertainty)
- both low and high level informations
- fills in missing parts (image, or thought)

Prediction = sensory anticipation + comparison with sensory stimulus

- Correct prediction $\rightarrow$ understanding
- Bad prediction $\rightarrow$ error $\rightarrow$ attention

Perception = senses + brain's prediction

Intelligence = memory + prediction $\rightarrow$ better behaviors

Actions/behaviors to make prediction come true: we think before we act.

Brain needs to:

- store "sequences of pattern" $\rightarrow$ make good predictions
- retrieve patterns by similarity to previous ones (auto-associative recall) $\rightarrow$ recall past patterns
- apply past knowledge to new situation $\rightarrow$ invariant memory storing


## 6 - How the cortex works

what we see $\neq$ what V1 sees $\rightarrow$ visual distortion

V1 to IT : local, ever changing to global, invariant. Best solution, with only 4 stages

> 4 anatomical stages, more if you unwrap time + feedbacks + top down modulation. Analogy from work perspective, we all work together & interate vs only one input at a time (make a house)

Need time dimension to recognize thnigs (audition & touch is evident, but less for vision because we can recognize object from a single fixation

> disagree, even with single fixation, times flows in the head too)

All prediction are learnt from experience

> not strictly speaking, as we are able to generalize and make analogies

Motor and sensory regions are intertwined

Hierarchical symmetry: every cortical regions goal is to find out
1. how inputs are related
2. memorize the sequence of correlations between them (?)
3. predict how inputs will behave in the future using the memory $\rightarrow$ and correct errors
4. ultimately to form invariante representations

> I don't like the way he says "stores" pattern, I think cortical areas represents things

Cortex hierarchical structure $\simeq$ real world hierarchical structure

sequence of pattern = set of pattern that occurs together (not necessary in the same order)

> very weird as a sequence implicitly evokes order

Each region learns sequence, develops names and passes the name up to the hierarchy

> Not necessarily here, can pass errors (cf predictive coding)

Name = constant pattern of cell firing

> $\neq$ label (only a tag) I agree with that view. But contradiction after when the name is just the labels ?

Kind of predictive coding: (p90)
- "issues rises up" the hierarchy until some areas knows what to do
- if low level regions fail to predict something, this is an error and is passed up the hierarchy

See, hear, percieve what we expect to

Brains has no template or prototypes to match inputs to, as classic AI does ($1^{st}$ gen)

> Why each region has to decide on one interpretation ? (p100)

- Layer 2 cells fire when prediction is good $\rightarrow$ represent the "name"
- Layer 3b cells fire when fail to predict $\rightarrow$ represent an error

Hippocampus very important for learning (p114), on top of the cortex hierarchy

Classifications of patterns and building sequences = building blocks or learning (p111)

> Diagree, and how did he come with this conclusion

Grouping patterns continguous in time

The more you study, the more cortex reforms representations and we move down these representations in the hierarchy = become expert, freeing up space for new things to learn (p113)

> As you age, your cortex is less flexible and plastic, so learning is more diffcult. It's not just a matter of space

Every region of the cortex try to UNDERSTAND what the information coming up means, but does not pass the details
> (not store), and disagree, details are passed, not the representation

On top, you only have the part of the input that is truly new and unexpected (p115)
> OK but contradiction with the previous statement

Information that is not pass down the cortex will be lost, not stored forever

The more you know, the less you remember
