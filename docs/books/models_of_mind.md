# Models of mind

## Spherical cows

Spider + web smarter than spider alone: known as « Extended cognition »

$\rightarrow$ Mathematics is an EC. Rely on EC because brain too small.


Mathematics:

- resumes concepts: 1 equation worth 1000 words
- sometimes requires too much simplification: spherical cow milk production
- helps where intuition is limited: predator-prey

## How Neurons get their spike

- 20th: Lapique made the link between ohms law and nerves. Equivalent circuit schema.
- 1960: leaky integrate and fire neuron:

    - Leaky: resistance
    - integrate: resistance
    - fire: threshold

Rall used cable theory to prove, before any experiment can be done, the role of dendrites for neural computation

$\rightarrow$ Dendrites (so neuron) are able to identify sequences (due to spiking time dependencies)

## Learning to compute

McCulloch and Pitts one of the first to link mind/logic with body/neuron through the logical function neurons. First artificial neural network.
> Artistery inherent to model building is the creative and subjective process to decide which facts belong to the foreground”

- 1958: First (photo)perceptron.

Put in practice McCulloch and Pitt’s equations. Rosenblatt added learning in perceptron. But not binary, not logic computations: ability over interpretability.

Albus links cerebellum and Purkinje cells with perceptron and supervised learning.

Winter for connectism and perceptron with XOR problem.

- 1986: multilayer perceptron solves the issue + backpropagation for learning .

## Making and maintaining memories
Engram vs ecphory (process that lay to memory vs retrieve memory).

- 1959: Hebbian learning.
- 1980: Hopfield dismayed by the qualitative approach bio and neuro have of the brain/mind. Appropriate mathematical langage and structure are needed.

- Hippocampus stores/buffers memory and replay it latter back to brain areas for learning/consolidation.
- Working memory in the frontal cortex.
- Ring networks (continuous attractor) vs hopfield (discrete attractor). Ring like network found in drosophilias, used for navigation.

## Exctitation and Inhibition

Noise in neurons:

- Maybe be just physiological ? Or useful to explore ?
- 20ms average integration: reduce effect of noisiness.
- Neurons output same level of noise as input.

Mean field theory trick where you don’t need to model multiple neurons network but feed own output as input

The more connection, the less weights (tested empirically)

Chaos: when small perturbation are amplified. Outcomes look random but not at all. Difficult to predict from rules.

## Stages of sight
1966 MIT summer camp to solve artificial vision (LOL)
Start with template maching
Flaws of démon individually matching shapes. New solution is  pandemonium.

??? question "What is the concept behind extended cognition?"
    Extended cognition refers to the idea that certain cognitive processes occur outside of an organism's brain and rely on external tools or structures, such as language or mathematics. In this case, mathematics is considered an example of extended cognition because it relies on external symbols and rules to process information.
