??? question "What is a restricted Boltzmann machine?"
    A restricted Boltzmann machine is a type of generative model used for unsupervised learning in artificial neural networks. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or "restrictors", that learn to map input data onto a lower-dimensional representation space. The RBM can be trained using an iterative process known as restricted Boltzmann training (RBT), which involves optimizing the parameters of the model to maximize the likelihood of the input data given the output representation.
