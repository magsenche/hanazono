## [Is Symmetry the Foundation of the Universe? Gauge Theory has an Answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paQLJKtiAEE&list=LL&index=1&t=66s)

Symmetry at the heart of physics. Every symmetry leads to fundamental laws and force.

`Noether's theorem`
: For every symmetry, their is a conservation law

- Time symmetry $\rightarrow$ conservation of energy
- Space symmetry $\rightarrow$ conservation of momentum

Symmetries are about actions, that in a sense, don't change everything. It give us the rules for transforming while conserving a quantity.

- Equilateral triangle: dihedral degree 3
- Square: dihedral degree 4

Much more simpler to describe group by their generator (small numbers) than by its elements (potentialy very large)

Examples:

- number of generator of a gauge group correspond to a fundamental particle mediating the corresponding force (photo, bosons etc)
- compute $\int e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}$ by using the radial symmetry of
$(\int e^{-x^2}dx)^2 = \iint_{\R^2} e^{-\left(x^2 + y^2\right)}dx\,dy = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-r^2}r\,dr\,d\theta$
