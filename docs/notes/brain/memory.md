## Engram

[Buidling blocks of memory in the brain](https://youtu.be/X5trRLX7PQY)

1) Information si encoded as synaptic changes in sparse populations of neurons **engrams**

   - engrams $\simeq$ associative memory
   - evidences for sparse distributed code

2) Engram sparsity is highly conserved and controlled through neuronal competition

   - sparsity degree $\not=$ across regions (high in hippocampus, low in cortex)

3) Activation of engram neurons is **necessary and sufficient** for memory recall

4) Engrams are **distributed** across a wide range of brain regions

   - $\rightarrow$ full memory encompass all different aspects

5) Multiple engrams are **linked** by **overlapping neurons** during **co-allocation or co-retrieval**

   - intrisic excitability of neurons is ever changing (waxes $\sim$ and wanes $\sim$) period $\simeq$ 12h
   - $\rightarrow$ allow $\not =$ engrams to be recruited for $\not =$ (in time) memories
   - $\rightarrow$ the closer experiences are, the more overlap engrams have, the more linked memories are

??? question "`Engram` [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    An engram is a representation of information encoded as synaptic changes in sparse populations of neurons. It is closely related to associative memory, and there is evidence to support the concept of a sparse distributed code for memory representation

??? question "How is engram sparsity conserved? How does it vary across brain regions? [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Engram sparsity is conserved and controlled through neuronal competition. The degree of sparsity differs across various brain regions, with it being high in the hippocampus and low in the cortex

??? question "Role of engram neurons in memory recall [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Activation of engram neurons is both necessary and sufficient for the recall of memories. This means that triggering these specific neurons can induce the retrieval of associated memories

??? question "How are engrams distributed? What does it mean for the nature of memory? [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Engrams are distributed across a wide range of brain regions, implying that a complete memory encompasses various aspects and is not localized to a single area

??? question "How are multiple engrams connected? What determine their overlap? [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Multiple engrams are linked by overlapping neurons during processes like co-allocation or co-retrieval. The intrinsic excitability of neurons changes over time, with cycles that wax and wane approximately every 12 hours. This variability allows different engrams to be recruited for different memories based on their timing. As a result, experiences that occur closer in time have engrams with more overlap, leading to more interconnected memories
