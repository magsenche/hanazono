## Dopamine
[Dopamine note](../health/dopamine.md)

## Adrenaline

Also know as **epinephrine**.

### Effects
- fight-or-flight response
- blood sugar levels
- heart rate

## Noradrenaline
Also known as **norepinephrine**

### Effects
It mobilizes body for action.

In the brain:

- increases arousal and alertness
- promotes vigilance
- enhances formation and retrieval of memory
- focuses attention
- increases restlessness and anxiety

In the rest of the body:

- increases heart rate and blood pressure
- triggers the release of glucose from energy stores
- increases blood flow to skeletal muscle
- reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system
- inhibits voiding of the bladder and gastrointestinal motility

### Release
Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response

??? question "Biosynthesis of adrenaline"
    L-phenylalanine $\rightarrow$ L-tyrosine $\rightarrow$ L-Dopa -> Dopamine $\rightarrow$ Noradrenaline $\rightarrow$ Adrenaline
