# Neurotransmitters

## Catecholamines
![](fig/catecholamines.png)

## Dopamine
[Dopamine note](../health/dopamine.md)

## Adrenaline
Also know as **epinephrine**.

### Effects
- fight-or-flight response
- blood sugar levels
- heart rate

## Noradrenaline
Also known as **norepinephrine**

### Effects
It mobilizes body for action.

In the brain:

- increases arousal and alertness
- promotes vigilance
- enhances formation and retrieval of memory
- focuses attention
- increases restlessness and anxiety

In the rest of the body:

- increases heart rate and blood pressure
- triggers the release of glucose from energy stores
- increases blood flow to skeletal muscle
- reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system
- inhibits voiding of the bladder and gastrointestinal motility

### Release
Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response

## Serotonin
Serotonin is a neurostransmitter that plays an important role in mood regulation, appetite, sleep, and memory formation. It also helps regulate the body's natural defenses.

In the brain:

- regulates mood, appetite, sleep, and memory
- helps maintain social behavior
- promotes feelings of well-being and happiness
- can cause anxiety or depression when levels are too low

In the rest of the body:

- controls blood sugar levels
- regulates digestion and appetite
- helps regulate sleep
- can cause diarrhea or constipation when levels are too high

### Release
Serotonin release is highest during sleep, drops during wakefulness, and rises again during stressful situations.

## Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in learning, memory, attention, and motor control.

In the brain:

- facilitates learning and memory
- improves attention and concentration
- enhances sensory perception
- helps with decision making and problem solving

In the rest of the body:

- regulates muscle contraction
- stimulates digestion and appetite
- controls heart rate and blood pressure

### Release
Acetylcholine release is highest during arousal and attention, and drops during sleep.

## Glutamate
Glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.

In the brain:

- facilitates learning and memory
- enhances synaptic plasticity
- promotes sensory perception
- helps with decision making and problem solving

In the rest of the body:

- regulates muscle contraction
- stimulates digestion and appetite
- controls heart rate and blood pressure

### Release
Glutamate release is highest during arousal and attention, and drops during sleep.

## GABA
GABA is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate the brain's activity by inhibiting the activity of other neurons.

In the brain:

- regulates anxiety and stress
- promotes sleep
- suppresses seizures
- enhances memory formation and retrieval

In the rest of the body:

- regulates muscle contraction
- stimulates digestion and appetite
- controls heart rate and blood pressure

### Release
GABA release is highest during relaxation and sleep, and drops during arousal and attention.
