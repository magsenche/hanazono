Subthreshold firing when adjacent electric signal travelling in another neuron.

Ephaptic interactions seems to contribute to neuronal synchrony in the hippocampus.

There are attraction/repulsion effects between neighboring signals/impulses depending on their distance and different coupling coefficient. Even new action potentials and backward signals can be generated through this phenomenon.

Ephaptic coupling can leed to self-organizaed trains of impulses and significant alteration of action potential's timings

> We hope these results will motivate a critical examination of the validity of the common assumption that neuronal fiber pathways merely act as transmission cables relaying signals between different brain regions.
In contrast to that latter viewpoint, this theoretical investigation suggests that ephaptic interactions enhanced by the orientations and bundling of neuronal tracts in three-dimensional space can render the fiber pathways an active axonal medium that can give rise to complex spatiotemporal dynamic.

> Heterogeneity of the axonal diameters has a dispersive effect, and that a higher level of heterogeneity requires stronger ephaptic coupling to achieve full synchronisation between spikes

??? question "Ephaptic interactions: what happens during subthreshold firing? [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Subthreshold firing occurs when an adjacent electric signal traveling in one neuron influences another neuron. Ephaptic interactions can contribute to neuronal synchrony, especially observed in the hippocampus. Depending on the distance between neighboring signals/impulses and different coupling coefficients, attraction or repulsion effects can arise. This phenomenon can even generate new action potentials and backward signals.

??? question "How can ephaptic interactions influence the behavior of neuronal fiber pathways? [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Ephaptic interactions, enhanced by the orientations and bundling of neuronal tracts in three-dimensional space, can transform fiber pathways into an active axonal medium. This can lead to complex spatiotemporal dynamics, challenging the common assumption that neuronal fiber pathways merely act as transmission cables between brain regions

??? question "Ephaptic interactions: What si the significance of axonal diameter heterogeneity? [](){.fbutton .ok}[](){.fbutton .nok}"
    Heterogeneity in axonal diameters has a dispersive effect on ephaptic interactions. A higher level of diameter heterogeneity demands stronger ephaptic coupling to achieve full synchronization between spikes
