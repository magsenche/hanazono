## **Reflexions sur la définition de la vie**

> There will never be a moment where we are like, "Aha, this is now sentient!". Gradually, more and more people will be inclined to take the intentional stance with these models. At some point, they will be considered effectively sentient, without us noticing even...
A lot of people struggle with this point, I find the following analogy helpful: it's like the word "alive". The word "alive" doesn't refer to a clear ontological category. Just as it is impossible to definitively say when something is alive or not, so it will be with sentience.
That doesn't mean we don't know some things are alive and some aren't. But, it does mean we draw arbitrary lines (e.g. Is someone brain-dead but who's heart is still beating alive? Is a virus alive?). That's because we invent these words - the categories don't exist otherwise.
