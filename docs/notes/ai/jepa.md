## JEPA

[Yann LeCun on a vision to make AI systems learn and reason like animals and humans](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/yann-lecun-advances-in-ai-research/)

Accumulated knowledge from prior experience build what we call common sense, which constitutes background knowledge of how the world works.
Allow human to plan effectively in unfamiliar situations by predicting what's likely, plausible, impossible..

Main challenges in AI is to find out how to learn these models in a self-supervised fashion, by changing current architectures and learning paradigms.

- The configurator module performs executive control: Given a task to be executed, it preconfigures the other modules
- The perception module receives signals from sensors and estimates the current state of the world.
- The world model module constitutes the most complex piece of the architecture. Its role is twofold: (1) to estimate missing information about the state of the world not provided by perception, and (2) to predict plausible future states of the world.
- The cost module computes a single scalar output that predicts the level of discomfort of the agent. It is composed of two submodules: the intrinsic cost, which is hard-wired and immutable (not trainable), and computes the immediate discomfort, and the critic, which is a trainable module that predicts future values of the intrinsic cost.
- The actor module computes proposals for action sequences.
- The short-term memory module keeps track of the current and predicted world state, as well as associated costs.

Yann LeCun promotes Hierarchical JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture)

To learn world models in an unsupervised fashion, recently we've been using contrastive methods a lot (which implies showing a lot of incompatibles samples to discrimate positive sample from - and this is not bioplausible). New methods live VICReg / JEPA:

- max MI(x)
- max MI(y)
- max p(y|x)
- min I(z) where z is the latent rpz of x
