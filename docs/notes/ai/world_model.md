> The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system.

> Evidence also suggests that what we perceive at any given moment is governed by our brainâ€™s prediction of the future based on our internal model

Example of baseball players hitting the baseball within a 100 ms window - which is faster than the signal coming from the eyes to reach the brain - because it anticipated the trajectory.
