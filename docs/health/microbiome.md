# Microbiome
We all have trillions of microorganisms living inside our gut—not just our stomach but our intesti­nes and throat and mouth, and on our skin, in our eyes and nasal passages. Maybe that sounds bad or gross, but… it turns out these microbiota are essential for our immune, brain and hormone health—in part because they make chemicals that immediately impact how the rest of our body functions, including neurotransmitters like serotonin. The bottom line is: we need to nurture these living microbiota cargo to best support our mental and physical health.

Microbiota diversity is a measurement of the number of different species of microbiota in our gut. Low diversity is considered a marker of dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) and has been associated with autoimmune diseases, obesity and cardiometabolic conditions.

## Eat Fermented Foods
Dr. Sonnenburg discussed the findings of his recent human study, in collaboration with Dr. Chris Gardner of Stanford, in which they investigated whether diets high in plant-based fiber or fermented foods would influence the health of the gut microbiome. Their results show that fermented foods increased overall gut microbiota diversity, as well as reduced key markers of inflammation (aka ‘inflammatome’).

​In the study, participants ate six servings per day of fermented foods, however, higher total amounts of ingested fermented foods did not lead to further benefits. Instead, consistently incorporate fermented foods into your daily diet to achieve better outcomes for gut microbiome health and inflammation reduction.

Try incorporating low-sugar fermented foods into your diet, such as sauerkraut, plain yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, natto, kefir or even drinking brine. Find these products in the refrigerator section to ensure there are live active cultures. (Shelf-stable fermented foods are pasteurized, therefore, will not offer the same boost to the gut microbiome.)

## What About Fiber?
In this study, a high-fiber diet did not lead to an increase in microbiota diversity. However, high-fiber diets did increase the amount of carbohydrate active enzymes which help digest fiber and could further enhance the microbiome’s ability to degrade other complex carbohydrates. Additionally, some participants in the high-fiber group showed a reduction in markers of inflammation. Plant-based, high-fiber foods (i.e., vegetables, legumes, and whole grains) offer significant benefits for overall health and can help provide key nutrients for established microbiota.

## Prebiotics and Probiotics

`Prebiotics`
: fermentable dietary fiber or microbiota-accessible carbohydrates; supplements of food for established gut microbiota

`Probiotics`
: live bacteria or yeasts that can colonize in the gut microbiome

`Synbiotics`
: mixtures of prebiotics and probiotics

Augmenting the gut microbiome with low levels of prebiotics and/or probiotics while still focusing on eating whole quality foods leads to improvement in gut microbiome health.

In cases of dysbiosis, such as after taking antibiotics, during high periods of stress, traveling or changing your diet, higher levels of prebiotics and/or probiotics can aid in recovery and replenish your gut microbiome.

## Sleep
As the gut microbiome is highly attuned to the amount of stress you experience (through direct links to cells of the immune system), achieving the proper quality (deep) and duration (generally 6-9 hours) of sleep each night is essential to manage stress and, in turn, to ensure gut microbiome health.

## Avoid Processed Foods
Foods additives are ubiquitous in processed foods. Emulsifiers, detergent-like additives, can disrupt the mucus layer of the GI tract. In animal models, emulsifiers reduce microbial diversity, induce low-grade inflammation, and cause an increase in body fat, higher blood sugar levels and insulin resistance – key markers of metabolic syndrome.

The typical Western Diet (i.e., high fat, low fiber, higher in processed foods) does not provide gut microbiota with many of the key essential nutrients. When you eat complex, plant-based fiber, the gut microbiota produces fermentation by-products, such as short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyrate). These substances reduce inflammation, help maintain the gut’s mucosal barrier, regulate the immune system, and modulate metabolism along the GI tract. To enhance the health of your gut microbiome, prioritize a diet rich in whole foods, plant-based fiber, and fermented foods.

## Don’t Over-Sanitize Your Environment
Microbiota are present on any and all surfaces which have come into contact with the environment. Dr. Sonnenburg notes, “Exposure to microbes from the environment is likely an important part of educating our immune systems and keeping everything in the proper balance.” The gut microbiome is also populated from social interactions, including skin contact by shaking hands, hugging, kissing etc. and interactions with pets and dirt, and grass. Over-sanitization of our environments or excessive use of antibiotics can eliminate sources of good gut microbiota. While it is still important to eliminate the introduction of disease-causing pathogens and harmful environmental chemicals (e.g., pesticides), consider that many environmental microbes play an integral role in the establishment and maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome.

??? question "What role do the microbiota in our gut play in our health?"
    Microbiota are essential for our immune, brain, and hormone health because they produce chemicals that impact our body's functions, including neurotransmitters like serotonin. They are crucial for both mental and physical health.

??? question "How does eating fermented foods affect gut microbiota diversity?"
    Eating fermented foods can increase overall gut microbiota diversity and reduce key markers of inflammation, thus enhancing gut health.

??? question "Why is a high-fiber diet beneficial for the gut microbiome?"
    While it may not increase microbiota diversity, a high-fiber diet can increase the amount of carbohydrate active enzymes, helping digest fiber and potentially enhancing the microbiome’s ability to degrade other complex carbohydrates. It can also provide key nutrients and potentially reduce inflammation markers.

??? question "How do prebiotics and probiotics support gut health?"
    Prebiotics provide food for established gut microbiota, while probiotics introduce live bacteria or yeasts that can colonize in the gut, enhancing gut microbiome health and potentially aiding recovery in cases of dysbiosis.

??? question "What are some tips to improve gut microbiome health?"
    1. Eat a high-fiber diet that is rich in whole plant foods, such as vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.
    2. Avoid processed foods, which contain additives that can disrupt the mucus layer of the GI tract.
    3. Prioritize fermented foods, which provide microbial diversity and improve gut health.
    4. Get adequate sleep, aiming for 6-8 hours per night.
    5. Limit exposure to pathogens or harmful chemicals in your environment to maintain a healthy gut microbiome.
