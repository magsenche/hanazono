# Immune System

The immune system is the body's protective network against pathogens, ensuring our health and well-being

## Overview
### Innate Immune System

The innate immune system's response is **local**, **immediate** and **non-specific**

- **Skin**: Acts as a natural barrier against pathogens
- **Mucous Membranes**: Protective linings in the nasal, oral, intestinal, and urogenital tracts
- **Macrophages**: Cells that engulf and digest pathogens
- **Natural Killer Cells**: A type of cytotoxic cell that targets virus-infected cells and tumors
- **Dendritic Cells**: Capture pathogens and present their antigens to cells of the adaptive immune system

### Adaptive Immune System
Specific response tailored to the pathogen and has memory of past infections

- **B Lymphocytes (B cells)**:
    - Produce antibodies that neutralize pathogens
    - Create immunological memory
- **T Lymphocytes (T cells)**:
    - Helper T cells stimulate B cells and other T cells
    - Cytotoxic T cells directly attack and kill infected cells
    - Regulatory T cells suppress the immune system, preventing over-activity
- **Antibodies**: Proteins that bind specifically to pathogens or their products

### Complement System
This system consists of a series of proteins that:

- Enhance the ability of antibodies to coat pathogens (opsonization)
- Directly lyse pathogens
- Recruit immune cells and trigger inflammation

## Immune Response Sequence

1. Pathogen breaches barrier $\rightarrow$ Activation of macrophages
2. Macrophages engulf the pathogen $\rightarrow$ Digestion through enzymes
3. Release of cytokines to alert the body of an infection $\rightarrow$ Inflammation $\rightarrow$ Increase in phagocytes, cytokines, and vasodilation
4. Cytokines differentiate into interleukins:
    - **Interleukin 1**: Induces fever, reduces appetite, and increases lethargy
    - **Interleukin 2**: Supports T cell proliferation
    - **Interleukin 6**: Involved in inflammation and B cell maturation
    - **Interleukin 8**: Attracts and activates white blood cells
5. Dendritic cells present pathogen antigens to T cells, activating the adaptive immune system
6. T cells coordinate the immune response, with helper T cells stimulating B cells to produce antibodies

## Immunity
### Pillars of the Immune System
- **Sleep**: Essential for immune function and cytokine production
- **Physical Activity**: Enhances lymph circulation, facilitating immune cell movement
- **Sun Exposure**: Primary source of Vitamin D, which supports immune function
- **Hygiene**: Crucial for preventing exposure to many pathogens

### Vitamins & Minerals
- **[Vitamin D](./micronutrient.md#vitamin-d)**
- **[Magnesium](./micronutrient.md#magnesium)**
- **[Zinc](./micronutrient.md#zinc)**
- **[Omega-3](./micronutrient.md#omega-3)**

### Seasonality
Why do we tend to get sicker in winter?

- Reduced sun exposure $\rightarrow$  Vitamin D deficiency
- Drier air $\rightarrow$ Mucous membranes become less effective
- More time indoors $\rightarrow$ Increased exposure to airborne pathogens
- Cold exposure $\rightarrow$ Potential suppression of immune function

## Infections
### Colds
- small viruses $\sim$ 5 $\mu m$
- contagion is mostly done by touching eyes/face
- people are contagious $\sim$ 6 days after peak symptoms

Includes B cells and T cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Adaptive immune response | One of the two main ways in which the immune system responds to pathogens. Provides long-lasting protection against specific pathogens but may take longer to start.                                                                                                                                        |
| Antibody                 | A small protein that binds to a specific antigen. Antibodies are made by plasma cells and help the immune system fight pathogens in various ways. The human immune system can generate billions of types of antibodies.                                                                                     |
| Antigen                  | A small piece of biological material (protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or nucleic acid) that can be recognized by the immune system. Antigens from pathogens or abnormal cells trigger an immune response.                                                                                                     |
| Apoptosis                | A process by which a cell destroys itself. Involves several chemical reactions that make the cell change appearance and then die. Apoptosis is often used to kill cells that are unneeded or abnormal.                                                                                                      |

Lymphoid progenitor cells differentiate into lymphocytes, and myeloid progenitor cells differentiate into other immune cells and red blood cells. Both types of progenitor cells come from stem cells in the bone marrow. |
| Spleen                   | An organ above the stomach that helps filter the blood. Contains immune cells that break down dead and dying red blood cells to recycle their parts.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Stem cells               | A cell that can develop into a variety of other cell types. Stem cells in the bone marrow can develop into immune cells and red blood cells.                                                                                                                                                                |
| T cell                   | An adaptive immune cell that helps the body respond to specific pathogens. Upon recognizing a specific antigen, T cells differentiate into helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells.                                                                                                                            |
| Thymus                   | An organ in the chest where immune cells called T cells develop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Tonsils                  | Small organs at the back of the throat that contain immune cells. These cells destroy inhaled or ingested microbes and warn the immune system about potential infections.                                                                                                                                   |
| Toxins                   | Harmful substances (typically small molecules or proteins) produced by living organisms, including some pathogens.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Vaccine                  | A substance that triggers an immune response against a pathogen without causing an infection. If the immune system encounters the same type of pathogen later, it can destroy the pathogen more quickly and efficiently than if the individual had not had a vaccine.                                       |

??? question "Describe the response and components of the innate immune system"
    The innate immune system's response is **local**, **immediate** and **non-specific**

    - **Skin**: Acts as a natural barrier against pathogens
    - **Mucous Membranes**: Protective linings in the nasal, oral, intestinal, and urogenital tracts
    - **Macrophages**: Cells that engulf and digest pathogens
    - **Natural Killer Cells**: A type of cytotoxic cell that targets virus-infected cells and tumors
    - **Dendritic Cells**: Capture pathogens and present their antigens to cells of the adaptive immune system

??? question "Describe the adaptive immune system"
    Specific response tailored to the pathogen and has memory of past infections

    - **B Lymphocytes (B cells)**:
        - Produce antibodies that neutralize pathogens
        - Create immunological memory
    - **T Lymphocytes (T cells)**:
        - Helper T cells stimulate B cells and other T cells
        - Cytotoxic T cells directly attack and kill infected cells
        - Regulatory T cells suppress the immune system, preventing over-activity
    - **Antibodies**: Proteins that bind specifically to pathogens or their products

??? question "What are the 6 steps of the immune response sequence?"
    1. Pathogen breaches barrier $\rightarrow$ Activation of macrophages
    2. Macrophages engulf the pathogen $\rightarrow$ Digestion through enzymes
    3. Release of cytokines to alert the body of an infection $\rightarrow$ Inflammation $\rightarrow$ Increase in phagocytes, cytokines, and vasodilation
    4. Cytokines differentiate into interleukins
    5. Dendritic cells present pathogen antigens to T cells, activating the adaptive immune system
    6. T cells coordinate the immune response, with helper T cells stimulating B cells to produce antibodies

??? question "List all 4 pillars of healthy immune system"
    1. **Sleep**: Essential for immune function and cytokine production
    2. **Physical Activity**: Enhances lymph circulation, facilitating immune cell movement
    3. **Sun Exposure**: Primary source of Vitamin D, which supports immune function
    4. **Hygiene**: Crucial for preventing exposure to many pathogens

??? question "List all 4 minerals and vitamines essential the immune system"
    - **Vitamin D**
    - **Magnesium**
    - **Zinc**
    - **Omega-3**
