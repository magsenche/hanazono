# Micronutrients

## Vitamin D
Synthetized naturally via sunlight exposure

- ⛑️ Enhances pathogen-fighting effects of monocytes and neutrophils
- 😁 Influences mood and hormone production
- ⬇️ Reduces inflammation
- 🦴 Contributs to bones health

## Magnesium
Most of people is carenced in magnesium. Take bisglycinate as it's the more bio-available.

- 🩺 Supports normal immune function
- 📶 Involved in cell signaling (muscle contraction, brain)
- ⬇️ Reduces inflammation and fatigue
- 🩸 Regulates blood sugar levels
- 😴 Helps fell asleep

## Zinc
- ⛑️ Crucial for the development and function of immune cells
- ✨ Acts as an antioxidant
- ✋🏽 Supports skin health
- 🏋️‍♂️ Maintains testosterone levels
- 😴 Improves sleep quality

Zinc, a vital trace element, plays significant roles in numerous physiological functions, including enzyme catalysis, immune function, protein folding, and acting as an antioxidant. Its deficiency is commonly seen in various diseases, particularly cancer. Zinc's crucial role in cellular processes like cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity, and deviations in zinc levels can significantly affect cellular function and contribute to carcinogenesis.

Recent studies and reviews have shown that low zinc levels are consistently observed across various types of cancers. For instance, patients with cancers of the esophagus, breast, liver, lung, and even gynecological cancers exhibit significantly lower zinc levels compared to healthy controls. This deficiency could potentially be leveraged as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, given the consistent pattern across different studies and cancer types.

Furthermore, the roles of zinc in cancer are not limited to its deficiency correlating with cancer incidence. Zinc also impacts cancer progression and patient outcomes. For example, zinc levels have been shown to correlate with disease severity and survival rates in liver and lung cancers. This suggests that beyond being a mere marker of disease, zinc status could potentially influence the therapeutic outcomes and overall prognosis of cancer patients.

The implications of zinc deficiency extend to the potential therapeutic roles of zinc supplementation. Preliminary studies suggest that zinc supplementation might reduce the risk of developing certain cancers and could be a supportive treatment alongside conventional cancer therapies. For instance, zinc supplementation has shown promise in maintaining liver function and reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic liver disease.

## Omega-3
Can't be synthetized naturally by the organism: need to be provided via food (oily fish) or supplements.

???+ question "What are the key 3 omega-3 fats? Where to find them?"
    - EPA and DHA (primarily found in fish)
    - ALA (primarily found in plant foods such as flax meal or canola oil).


- ⛑️ Modulates immune function
- ✨ Supports health of cell membranes
- ⬇️ Reduces inflammation

???+ question "What's an indicator of a good omega-3 source?"
    - TOTOX (TOTal OXydation) index indicates the freshness of the oil: the lower, the better (<10)
    - DHA % (hardy sunthetized by the organism)
