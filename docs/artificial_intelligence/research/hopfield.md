# Hopfield networks

## What is it ?

Neural networks that stores patterns in memory as minimums of an energy.

Retrieval of a pattern is done via updating states from initial state until an equilibrium is reached

Several models:
- classical where each state is binary
- modern where states can be floats
- ...

??? question "What is the purpose of Hopfield networks?"
    The purpose of Hopfield networks is to store patterns in memory and retrieve them using a process of state updating until an equilibrium is reached.
