# Cognitive biases
Being aware of our cognitive biases is essential for making informed decisions and navigating the world effectively.

These biases are mental shortcuts that help us process information quickly, but they can also lead to errors in judgment. Understanding common cognitive biases allows us to recognize their influence and make more objective assessments.

## Attentional Biases

=== "Negativity Bias"
    We pay more attention to negative information than positive, impacting our mood, judgments, and decisions.

    ???+ example
        Remembering a critical comment more vividly than a compliment.

=== "Confirmation Bias"
    We seek information that confirms our existing beliefs and downplay or ignore conflicting information.

    ???+ example
        Only reading news articles that align with your political views.

=== "Salience Bias"
    We weigh readily available and easily recalled information more heavily, even if it's not necessarily accurate or relevant.

    ???+ example
        Making judgments based on recent headlines rather than a comprehensive analysis.

## Memory Biases

=== "Hindsight Bias"
    We tend to believe we could have predicted an event after it has already happened, even when we couldn't have at the time.

    ???+ example
        Saying "I knew it!" after something negative occurs.

=== "Availability Heuristic"
    We judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can recall similar events, which can be misleading.

    ???+ example
        Overestimating the risk of plane crashes after seeing a news report about one.

=== "Recency Bias"
    We give more weight to recent information than to older information, even if it's not necessarily more important.

    ???+ example
        Focusing more on your latest performance review than your overall track record.

## Social Biases

=== "In-Group Bias"
    We tend to favor people and groups that we identify with, leading to discrimination against others.

    ???+ example
        Preferring to hire applicants from your own university.

=== "Outgroup Homogeneity Bias"
    We tend to perceive members of other groups as being more similar to each other than they actually are.

    ???+ example
        Stereotyping entire cultures based on limited contact with a few individuals.

=== "Self-Serving Bias"
    We attribute positive outcomes to our own abilities and negative outcomes to external factors.

    ???+ example
        Taking credit for successes but blaming failures on bad luck or others.

=== "Round Number Bias"
    Occurs when individuals favor and strive towards "round numbers". It results from a preference for simplicity and ease of processing.

    Can be seen in some cases where the [Central Limit Theorem](../maths/probability/index.md#central-limit-theorem) does not apply on some social experiment. Instead, we observe a roughly normal disitribution but with peaks around "round numbers"

    ???+ example
        - Sprinting to finish a race in 4:00 rather than 4:01
        - Achieving a 2000 rating in chess and stop playing

## Motivational Biases

=== "Anchoring Bias"
    We rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making judgments, even if it's not relevant or accurate.

    ???+ example
        Being persuaded by a high initial asking price in a negotiation

=== "Framing Bias"
    The way information is presented can influence our choices, even if the content is essentially the same.

    ???+ example
        Choosing a product labeled "90% fat-free" over one labeled "10% fat."

=== "Sunk Cost Fallacy"
    We continue to invest time, money, or effort into a losing proposition because we've already put something in.

    ???+ example
        Staying in a bad relationship because you've been together for a long time.
