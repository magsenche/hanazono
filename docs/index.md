## Questions

??? tip " What did you work on in the last two years that makes you proud ?"
    I'm most proud of building a **personal knowledge management website** using mkdocs and a Django server.

    * **Problem:** I struggled with finding a system to organize my diverse notes (math, coding, health, etc.) and retain key information efficiently.
    * **Solution:** So, I built a platform that not only stores my notes but also incorporates a spaced repetition algorithm based on Leitner boxes. Each day, the website presents me with flashcards based on my notes, helping me solidify my understanding.
    * **Impact:** Not only has this project improved my organization and productivity, but it's also helped me reduce forgetting crucial information by having hundreds of flashcards for now, with ~10 daily to answer.
    * **Technical Implementation**: This experience allowed me to learn and apply various technical skills, including Django, Docker, Git, LLMs, Python, SQL, Javascript.. and problem-solving to overcome challenges like [mention specific technical hurdle].

    This project is especially helpful for managing my health and fitness knowledge. As someone who struggled to find a sustainable sport before discovering **CrossFit** two years ago, I understand the importance of creating systems that support long-term healthy habits.

    My experience with CrossFit has instilled in me the value of discipline, perseverance, and self-motivation, which I believe are crucial for success in any endeavor.

    fin

    - deuxieme restructuration, nouvelle équipe, depart quasi zéro
    - réflexion plus fondamentale sur l'IA générale de A à Z
    - automates cellulaires pour les textures
